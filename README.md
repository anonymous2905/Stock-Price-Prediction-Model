README for Stock Price Prediction Project
Project Overview
This project aims to predict stock prices for companies categorized as large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap. It involves data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and selection of the best-performing model based on mean squared error (MSE).

Project Structure
data/
Contains CSV files for large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap stock data.
notebooks/
Contains the Jupyter Notebook stock_price_model_prediction.ipynb.
models/
Directory for storing trained models (if needed).
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash


Copy code


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git


cd stock-price-prediction


Install required packages:

Notebook Contents
Data Collection:

Merges stock price data from multiple CSV files for large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap categories.
Data Preprocessing:

Prepares datasets by selecting relevant features such as Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume.
Model Selection and Training:

Utilizes Ridge Regression, RandomForestRegressor, and GradientBoostingRegressor.
Implements a pipeline for data scaling and model fitting.
Performs grid search with cross-validation to find the best hyperparameters for each model.
Evaluation and Results:

Splits the data into training and testing sets.
Evaluates models based on mean squared error (MSE).
Identifies Ridge Regression as the best model with the lowest MSE values for all stock categories.
Results

Best Model: Ridge Regression
Training MSE: 515.29
Testing MSE: 1164.81
Mid-Cap Stocks:

Best Model: Ridge Regression
Training MSE: 2182.64
Testing MSE: 1321.33
Small-Cap Stocks:

Testing MSE: 1101.69
Future Improvements
Incorporate more features like macroeconomic indicators.
Experiment with advanced models like LSTM for time-series prediction.
Enhance data preprocessing with feature engineering techniques.
